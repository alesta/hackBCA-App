hackBCA-App
===========

An educational game made for HackBCA.

Ideas
=====

1. Check to see if the LE structure for their molecule is valid
	* Valid if each atom has a full V shell and 2(#bonds + #LP's) = #V e-, otherwise invalid

2. Add functionality for ions (simply, add or subtract from the number of valence electrons)

3. POSSIBLY (if time permits) check the validity of a molecule (does it exist in nature in this form?)

TODO
====

1. Set up GUI (Periodic table and tools for modifying the number of V e-)

2. Hash table mapping Element symbols to atoms structures
	* Atom structure: configuration of ports, valence electrons

3. Method to affix atoms to eachother via bonds

For later on:

4. Hash table mapping configurations of occupied areas to bond angles
